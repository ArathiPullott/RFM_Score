# RFM_Score
The main aim is to group customers based on their purchasing behaviour. The combination of Recency, Frequency and Monetary forms the RFM Score, a numerical representation of a customer's overall engagement and value to the business.
Recency measured as the time since the customer's last transaction.
Frequency measured as the total number of transactions over a specific time period.
Monetary measured as the total amount of money spent by the customer over a specific time period.
I segmented customers as Champions, Loyal customers, Potential Loyalist, New customers, Promising customers, Needing attention, About to sleep, At risk, Can't loose them and Hibernating.
